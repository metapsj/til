### The ultimate headlight upgrade H4 (not LED or HID)

My build goal is to drastically increase the light output from the stock headlights
without sacrificing quality, durability or the OEM lighting optics and improve the
look of the truck at the same time.

Rather than trying to change the technology that is used by the halogen reflector
headlights (like improperly stuffing HID or LED bulbs in a reflector lens designed
specifically for halogen bulbs), I just improved on the same technology by cranking
up the power, adding some new school tricks to old school tech, and improved the
efficiency while selecting better looking OEM parts.
